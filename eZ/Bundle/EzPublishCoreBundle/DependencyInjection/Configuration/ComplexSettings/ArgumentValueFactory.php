 * Factory for complex dynamic settings resolution.

 * Meant to be added, as a service, in place of a complex argument, containing one or more dynamic setting
 * within another string.
 *
 * During the ComplexSettingPass, an instance of this factory will be created, and will be added one addDynamicSetting
 * call per setting in the string. The settings in these calls will be replaced by the ConfigResolverCompilerPass.
 * When the services using those factories are built, every dynamic setting in the string
 * is resolved, and the setting is replaced with its value in the string, and returned.
